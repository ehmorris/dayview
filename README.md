#### Ideas
* Plane-ar navigation scheme i.e. you zoom into a location to recieve details on it (average time spent there, number of times visited, usual incoming path, etc.) rather than clicking "how long do i usually spend here." Think Iron Man HUD. Zooming in makes the previous content zoom close to you, like you're speeding past it, in perspective with the map.
* Maybe something like swath summaries could allow someone to find interesting seasons more easily, when faced with 10+ years of daily entries: summarize a summer in a few sentences, a school semester, etc.
* On the broad strokes made possible by this data: [whichlight's post](http://blog.whichlight.com/post/65575793300/how-the-entropy-of-personal-behaviors-and-social)

#### Example apps
* Z-index navigation: ([Orchestra](http://play.lso.co.uk/#/Ravels-Bolero/orchestra) + [Hover States](http://hoverstat.es/posts/lso-play/)) & [Zoom thumbnail groups](http://hoverstat.es/posts/jake-dinos-chapman/)
