Plane-ar navigation scheme i.e. you zoom into a location to recieve details on it (average time spent there, number of times visited, usual incoming path, etc.) rather than clicking "how long do i usually spend here." Think Iron Man HUD. Zooming in makes the previous content zoom close to you, like you're speeding past it, in perspective with the map.
