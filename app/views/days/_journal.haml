    %p I had a haircut appointment before noon today, so at least I had a reason to get out of bed. I arrived just on time and talked with Josh about Puerto Rico and school — it was a good haircut. I didn&rsquo;t quite know where to go afterwards but I always enjoy being around the South End. I walked around until I thought of going to Bostonian Market for a cheap sandwich. I&rsquo;d just read a great article about a food and blankets van that Pine Street Inn sends around Downtown Crossing at night during the winter, so it was nice to watch the Pine Street people across the street / in the market while I ate. Maybe once I have more time in NY I&rsquo;ll volunteer at a place like Pine Street.
    %p I got the bus home and took a long nap before heading to Gallows for Ben&rsquo;s goodbye party — he leaves for NY and Yahoo on Friday. I chatted with the guy from Pilot who I&rsquo;ve met before (Ben was getting hounded by everyone he knew), and I tried a &ldquo;Scotch Egg&rdquo; for the first time which is a $6 egg (at Gallows at least) that&rsquo;s breaded and fried and contains shredded pork. I got some advice on submitting my notice from Ben, who&rsquo;s been around the block.
    %p Tasty Tuesday was happening and I was already late, so I got an UberX from Foodie&rsquo;s to to Nicole&rsquo;s to catch the last of it — the ride only took 5 mins and cost $5, which is crazy cheap to me. Less than a Scotch Egg. I hung around with everyone until Nicole kicked us out, but I was kinda being a bum on the couch the whole time.
